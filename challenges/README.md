# Challenges Directory

This directory contains GNU Radio flowgraphs and generated Python code for various SDR challenges.

## Working with GRC Flowgraphs

Some flowgraphs use embedded Python modules (epy_module) that require special handling for imports.

### FHSS (Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum)

The `fhss_tx.grc` flowgraph uses an embedded Python module (`fhss_tx_hop_set`) that is automatically generated by GRC. However, GRC generates a simple import that doesn't work when the module is imported as part of the `challenges` package from `challengectl.py`.

**After regenerating `fhss_tx.py` from the GRC file:**

```bash
# Generate Python from GRC
grcc fhss_tx.grc

# Fix the import to support both package and standalone usage
../fix-fhss-import.sh
```

The script replaces the simple import with try/except logic that supports both:
- Relative imports (when used as a package): `from . import fhss_tx_hop_set`
- Direct imports (when run standalone): `import fhss_tx_hop_set`

### Alternative: Manual Fix

If you prefer to fix manually, replace:
```python
import fhss_tx_hop_set as hop_set
```

With:
```python
try:
    from . import fhss_tx_hop_set as hop_set
except ImportError:
    import fhss_tx_hop_set as hop_set
```
