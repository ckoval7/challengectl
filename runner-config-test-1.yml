# ChallengeCtl Runner Configuration Example
# Copy this file to runner-config.yml and customize for each runner

runner:
  # Unique identifier for this runner
  # Must match an entry in server-config.yml api_keys
  runner_id: "runner-1"

  # Server URL (use HTTPS in production)
  server_url: "http://localhost:8080"

  # API key for authentication (must match server-config.yml)
  # Generate with: python3 generate-api-key.py
  api_key: "CHANGE-THIS-runner-1-key-abc123"

  # TLS/SSL Configuration
  # Path to CA certificate file for server verification
  # Leave blank to use system CA certificates
  ca_cert: ""

  # Set to false to disable SSL verification (DEVELOPMENT ONLY!)
  # In production, always use verify_ssl: true with proper certificates
  verify_ssl: false

  # Cache directory for downloaded challenge files (relative to runner directory)
  cache_dir: "cache"

  # Heartbeat interval (seconds) - how often to ping server
  heartbeat_interval: 30

  # Poll interval (seconds) - how often to request new tasks
  poll_interval: 10

# Radio/SDR Device Configuration
